## Support My Work

You can [become a sponsor][Sponsors] to help me dedicate more time on my various [open-source tools][OpenSource]. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a real difference in keeping these tools free and actively developed.



## Getting Started

PickerKit has many additional picker utilities, like:

* ``Camera`` can take photos and handle them as images.
* ``ColorPickerBar`` adds additional colors to a color picker.
* ``DocumentScanner`` can scan documents and handle them as images.
* ``FilePicker`` can pick files from the Files app.
* ``FontPicker`` can pick system and custom fonts.
* ``ImagePicker`` can pick images from the photo library.

There are also general utilities like:

* ``ForEachPicker`` can be used to pick single items in a `ForEach`.
* ``MultiPicker`` can be used to pick multiple items in a `ForEach`.

Note that you must add the proper permissions to be able to access the camera, photo album, files, etc.



## Documentation

The online [documentation][Documentation] has more information, articles, code examples, etc.



## Demo Application

The `Demo` folder has a demo app that lets you test the various pickers in the library.
